# 🌿 Community Mangrove Watch

Empowering communities through innovative technology to protect our vital coastal ecosystems.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
Mangrove forests are lifelines for coastal regions — they protect against storms, prevent erosion, and serve as nurseries for marine life. Unfortunately, they are under severe threat from illegal cutting, waste dumping, and destructive land reclamation.

**Community Mangrove Watch** provides a **community-powered monitoring solution** that bridges the gap between local observation and official action.  

---

## 🚨 The Challenge
- Mangrove forests are rapidly disappearing due to human activities.
- No transparent, real-time monitoring system currently exists.
- Community reports are often ignored or lost without proper channels.

---

## 💡 Our Solution
1. **Community Reporting Platform**  
   - Residents upload geotagged photos & descriptions of threats.  
   - Reports stored securely for validation.  

2. **Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard**  
   - NGOs & government see incidents on a live interactive map.  
   - Authorities can validate and act immediately.  

3. **Gamified Engagement**  
   - Leaderboards & badges encourage ongoing community participation.  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
- **Community Reporter:** Users submit reports with auto-location + media.  
- **Admin Dashboard:** Admins validate, filter, and export reports for action.  
- **Gamification:** Contributors earn points, badges, and recognition.
